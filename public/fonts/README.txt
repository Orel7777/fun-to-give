Place the Staff-Regular font files in this folder with the exact filenames referenced by app/globals.css:

- Staff-Regular.woff2
- Staff-Regular.woff
- Staff-Regular.ttf

These files are required for the `font-staff` class to render correctly across the site.

If you have different filenames, either rename them to match the above or update the @font-face src URLs in app/globals.css accordingly.
