# Hebrew Content and RTL Layout Guidelines

## Text Direction:
- Always use `dir="rtl"` for containers with Hebrew text
- Use `text-right` class for right-aligned text
- Ensure proper text flow for mixed Hebrew/English content

## Font Usage:
- Use custom Hebrew fonts from [app/fonts/](mdc:app/fonts/)
- Load fonts properly in [app/layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx)
- Ensure fallback fonts for better loading experience

## Content Structure:
- Hebrew titles and headings should be prominent
- Use proper Hebrew punctuation and grammar
- Maintain consistent terminology across the site
- Consider cultural context for content placement

## Layout Considerations:
- Cards and sections should flow right-to-left
- Icons and images should be positioned appropriately for RTL
- Animation directions should respect RTL layout
- Spacing and margins should work well with Hebrew text

## Accessibility:
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for Hebrew text
- Use semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support
- Test with Hebrew screen readers when possible
